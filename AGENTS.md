## Project intent

nter.pro mobile is the phone app for nter.pro (Android, iPhone and an installable web app). It is
a **client** of the existing nter.pro backend: the NTER Supabase project and www.nter.pro's public
`/api`. It has no server and no database of its own, and it adds no tables, columns, functions or
policies to NTER.

The website lives in `ddllabs/niyantran`; its `AGENTS.md` governs the backend. This repository
follows the same stack and conventions: React 19 + Vite, plain JavaScript (JSX), Node 24, ESLint 9,
Vitest with tests next to the code, `src/lib/supabaseClient.js`, `src/lib/citationMarkers.js`.

## Required reading

1. This file.
2. `docs/START-HERE.md` — reading order, setup, how the pieces fit.
3. `docs/backend-contract.md` — every call the app makes and its shape.
4. `docs/plans/open-work.md` — what is open and on whom.

## Authority

- The owner decides product scope, releases, store submissions and anything that touches NTER or
  the website.
- **Never change NTER or the website from this repository**: no migrations, no edge-function
  deploys, no secret or auth-setting changes, no writes with a service-role key. Changes the app
  would benefit from are written up in `docs/plans/open-work.md` for the website team to make.
- No service-role key, provider key or other secret may enter this repository. The only key the
  app ships is the Supabase publishable key, which is public by design.

## How work proceeds

- Read the code before changing it; keep changes small and inside the requested scope.
- Shapes of backend data are defined by the website's code and migrations. When they change there,
  update `docs/backend-contract.md`, the live service and the sample together.
- Database access while building or debugging is read-only (`select`, read RPCs). See
  `supabase/README.md`.

## Definition of done

All of these pass locally and in CI before a change is merged:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test                    # unit tests (src/**/*.test.js)
npm run build && npm run build:web && npm run build:sample
npm run test:smoke          # whole app in Chromium on the sample, no network
npm run test:smoke:live     # live build in Chromium against a stand-in backend
```

`npm run check:backend` (against the real backend) is run before a release.
